# Code Style:
  We have decided to use the original Python style guide and the JavaScript standard style.

## IDE Style Setup:

### Python/Pycharm

  Pycharm uses the Python style guide by default, including listing the python style guide rule numbers for violations. If you changed Pycharm's style checking manually, here's how to reset it to the default:
1. Open the settings dialog (File->Setting or Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows)
2. Expand the Editor dropdown and select Code Style
3. Click the gear at the top of the window and select Restore Defaults

### Javascript/Webstorm

Webstorm makes it easy to use the JavaScript standard style rules for formatting. The process is similar to the steps for Pycharm as they are both Intellij-based IDEs.
1. Open the settings dialog (File->Setting or Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows)
2. Expand the Editor dropdown, expand the Code Style dropdown, and select JavaScript.
3. Click the Set from... link at the upper right side of the page and select JavaScript Standard Style.
